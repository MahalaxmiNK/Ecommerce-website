# STAssignment

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.17.



## Development server

Steps to run the project:

1.Go to project directory in the terminal
2.Install node modules using `npm install`
3.Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. 


## Assumptions made: 

The url `https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0455/2176/4502/files/products.json` given in the document has error in the JSON as , is added for last object.
So I have created stub data with same content stored it in an application and consuming in the frontend.

The functionalities covered are as below.
 1.filtering based on product tag
 2.Sorting based on Price
 3.Selecting a product and add to cart. When the product is added the count is updated on the cart icon.
 4.The developement was done on the mac book pro with resolution of 3072Ã—1920.So the UI looks perfect on the mac. But this is been made responsive about 90% for windows as well(as looked from developer tools).
